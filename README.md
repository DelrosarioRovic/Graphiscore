<h1>GraphiScore Rating and Review Application</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This web application allows users to rate and review different graphics processing units (GPUs) based on their personal experiences. Users can rate GPUs on a scale of 1-5 and leave a detailed review with their thoughts and opinions. Other users can read and filter through reviews to help inform their own purchasing decisions.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>The GraphiScore Rating and Review Application was built using the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, EJS</li>
  <li>Back-end: Express, Node.js</li>
  <li>Database: MongoDB, Mongoose</li>
</ul>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>The design of this application was inspired by the Cafely website, which can be found at https://cafely.vercel.app/. The clean and simple layout, neutral color palette, and use of high-quality images were elements that I sought to incorporate into this project.</p>
